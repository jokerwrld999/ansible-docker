## Ansible Docker

This project is a collaboration of two powerful tools - the **Configuration Management** (CM) tool, Ansible, and the Containerization tool, Docker.

## Typical Deployment Problems

    When it comes to deployment, several problems can arise, such as:

* Dependency conflicts (aka dependencies hell)

* The app works on one server but not on another

* Scaling is not easy and can be time-consuming

## Alternative Solution - Docker

    One of the best solutions to the above problems is Docker. Docker offers:

* A persistent and isolated environment for deploying applications

* Lightweight management, easy updates, and rollback of applications

* Easy scaling under pressure

* A convenient way to deliver apps

* Simple network configuration and Service Discovery

## Problems of Administration

    When administering a system, several problems may arise, such as:

* Continuously repeated tasks

* Slow integration and code delivery

* Vague state of servers and absent Single Source of Truth (SSOT)

## Ansible Solution

    To overcome the above problems, Ansible offers:

* Simple automation of hard and repeated tasks

* Infrastructure as Code (IAC)

* Time-saving and support for templating

* Agentless (plug and play)

## APP Overview

The base React web app converts images using the Nest.js API, RabbitMQ, Converter Microservices, and Reverse proxy Nginx.
